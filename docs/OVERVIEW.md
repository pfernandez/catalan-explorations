# The Catalan Rule — Overview

This document is the conceptual front door for the project.

If the repository root says **what** exists, this explains **why** it exists and **how the pieces relate**—without assuming you’ve already signed up for any of the physics speculation.

## 1. Starting Point: `()` as Vacuum + Structure

We commit to a minimal ontology:

- `()` is the **vacuum symbol**.
- Pairing `()` with itself (and with larger paired forms) gives us:
  - balanced parentheses (Dyck words),
  - binary trees,
  - noncrossing matchings.

These are all classic **Catalan** objects.

We take them as:

- a **possibility space** of well-formed configurations,
- a discrete model of **nested causality** (opens before closes),
- the substrate on which we test:
  1. universal computation,
  2. stable motifs and cycles,
  3. physics-like diagrammatics,
  4. reflective memory / attention mechanisms.

Everything else is built on top.

## 2. Dyck Paths as Discrete Spacetime Sketches

Each Dyck word can be viewed as a path:

- `(` = up-step, `)` = down-step,
- never go below height 0,
- start and end at 0.

Example (small `n`):

```text
n = 0:
    ()

n = 1:
    (())
    ()()

n = 2:
    ((()))
    (()())
    (())()
    ()(())
    ()()()
```

Path view (height vs position) for a simple word like (()()):

```text
word:   ( ( ) ( ) )
step:   + + - + - -
height: 0 1 2 1 2 1 0

    2 |      /\
    1 |   /\/  \
    0 |__/      \__
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6  (position)
```

This suggests:
	•	height ≈ causal depth / “time”,
	•	horizontal position / branching ≈ “space” / multiplicity of compatible futures,
	•	Dyck ensemble ≈ structured histories of a system.

Known scaling limits (Dyck paths → Brownian excursions) provide a rigorous bridge from:

discrete Catalan combinatorics → continuous path-like behavior.

We use that as a design constraint: any dynamics we propose should make sense on this spacetime-like scaffold.

3. Collapse as Dynamics (and a Gravity Analogy)

On this scaffold, we define local collapse rules: ways to rewrite or “evaluate” Catalan structures.

At minimum:
	•	(() x) ⇒ x (a binder applied to an argument collapses structurally)

And more generally:
	•	policies that prefer:
	•	leftmost vs rightmost,
	•	deeper vs shallower,
	•	heavier vs lighter branches,
	•	or only certain balanced subforms.

We then:
	•	run these rules on Catalan trees,
	•	track which shapes:
	•	recur frequently,
	•	survive as stable substructures,
	•	act as attractors.

This supports a structural analogy:
	•	For a partial history (H), let allowed future continuations be its consistent extensions.
	•	Regions/motifs that admit many extensions behave like wells:
	•	histories “fall into” them.
	•	Regions/motifs that drastically restrict extensions act like barriers.

Interpreted cautiously:
	•	motif density ~ how many histories pass through a configuration,
	•	forces ~ gradients in this density / consistent-futures count,
	•	gravity-like behavior ~ the tendency of collapse dynamics to concentrate histories into certain structural wells.

This is not GR, but it is a concrete way to study:

“collapse of realized history shapes effective geometry.”

The code lets you experiment with this rather than just read about it.

4. Pure Structural SK / λ from ()

To ensure the foundation isn’t hand-wavy, we implement a minimal universal computer directly on the same substrate.

Core encoding:
	•	Binders as (() body) — introduce an argument slot.
	•	Variables as #n — De Bruijn index into enclosing binders.
	•	Application as binary pairing.
	•	Evaluation as repeated structural collapse:
	•	(() x) ⇒ x plus recursive substitution.

In programs/sk-basis.lisp we define:
	•	I, K, S,
	•	booleans,
	•	function composition,

purely as Catalan trees, with no extra opcodes.

Conclusion:

The () + pairing + collapse universe is Turing-complete.

This computational core is intentionally tight and independently valuable, even if you ignore all physical analogies.

5. Motifs, Cycles, and Structural Sharing

Given an acyclic causal evolution (no loops in time), we do something crucial:
	1.	Identify isomorphic subtrees / motifs in the history.
	2.	Collapse each equivalence class into a node in a pattern graph.

The pattern graph can contain cycles even though the underlying causal tree is acyclic.

ASCII sketch:
```text
Causal tree (unfolded):

        A
       / \
      B   B
     /     \
    C       C
```

Pattern graph (quotiented by shape):

```text
    [A]
     |
    [B]
     |
    [C]
```

If A → B → C → B → C ... patterns repeat,
the pattern graph may show cycles even though time doesn't loop.

Interpretation:
	•	Recurrent motifs = fixed points of the dynamics.
	•	Cycles in the pattern graph = reentry of the same structural form.
	•	Indistinguishable “particles” or “roles” = many embeddings of the same motif-class in different regions of the causal tree.

This offers a clean structural reading of:
	•	“one field, many quanta,”
	•	Wheeler-style “one electron” as one conserved pattern re-used everywhere,

without violating causality.

6. Diagrams, Gauge, and Fields (Work in Progress)

The same machinery naturally touches familiar field-theoretic structures:

Feynman-like diagrams
	•	Local collapse events ↔ interaction vertices.
	•	Persistent links / substructures ↔ propagators.
	•	Complete collapse histories ↔ diagrams summing possible interaction patterns.

In this view, diagrams are compressed views of Catalan rewrite histories.

Gauge-like freedom

Once we attach internal labels to motifs (e.g. phases, “colors”):
	•	multiple local encodings that yield the same observable motif patterns
behave like gauge transformations:
	•	local changes of representation,
	•	no change in physical invariants (closed-loop traces, motif frequencies, etc.).

Wilson-loop style structures

Closed structural loops and their invariants over internal labels:
	•	can be defined directly on the Catalan / noncrossing diagrams,
	•	providing a natural place to study confinement-like behavior via loop expectations.

These connections are framed here as questions to test:
	•	Can standard diagrammatics be reconstructed as views of Catalan histories + weights?
	•	Can gauge redundancies and effective couplings emerge from the statistics of realized vs unrealized possibilities?

The code is organized so we can approach this incrementally, starting from solid combinatorics.

7. Attention & Memory (Scheme Experiment)

An early Scheme fragment (kept intentionally) models:
	•	a frame as (cons focus rest),
	•	a program as a list of navigation ops,
	•	an agent as:
	•	an identifier,
	•	plus a procedure for walking that structure.

This was an initial attempt at:
	•	a self-evaluating structural computer, and
	•	a Turing-like read-head over memory:
	•	an attention mechanism that traverses and rewrites cons-based histories.

While the modern SK/Catalan engine is cleaner, the intent is the same:

unify computation, memory, and observation as operations on the same ()-based substrate.

8. Putting the Pieces Together (Diagram)

A compact visual stack of how the concepts relate:

```text
   [ Layer 4: Physical / Semantic Interpretations ]
          |  (QFT diagrams, gauge-like symmetries, gravity analogies)
          v
   [ Layer 3: Pattern Graph ]
          |  motifs, cycles, reentry, "particle" forms
          v
   [ Layer 2: Dynamics / Collapse ]
          |  local rules, evaluation, motif statistics
          v
   [ Layer 1: Catalan Structures ]
          |  Dyck words, trees, noncrossing diagrams
          v
   [ Layer 0: `()` ]
          vacuum symbol, pure pairing
```

Everything above Layer 1 is optional interpretation.
Everything from Layer 1 down is concrete structure you can inspect in this repo.

9. How to Navigate the Repo

Recommended entry points:
	1.	README.md
	•	High-level purpose, how to run things.
	2.	src/sk.js + programs/sk-basis.lisp
	•	See how SK/λ live in pure ()-structure.
	3.	src/motif-discover.js + src/collapse-policy.js
	•	Explore collapse rules and motif statistics.
	4.	docs/
	•	For essays and deeper dives into:
	•	collapse-as-geometry,
	•	structural diagrammatics,
	•	reflective memory.

You can engage at three levels:
	1.	As a combinatorics & interpreter playground.
	2.	As a structural approach to agents / memory / attention.
	3.	As a hypothesis lab for how computation-like structure might underwrite physics.

Each level stands on its own; nothing requires belief beyond the code it runs on.
